# drd's dotfiles

Small dotfiles collection for quickly bootstrapping a fresh linux install.

To symlink all the needed config files use stow: all folders are stowable.

If you find any conflicts, consider deleting the already existing files or just adopting them (`stow --adopt <stow-folder-to-update>`). 

Remember that these dotfiles satisfy MY preferences.
